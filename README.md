# PillPal Android Application

PillPal is a medication management and administration application, that helps healthcare providers and patients better manage their treatments. The application provides medication schedules and reminders, along with other features to help secure and improve drug administration. 

The idea from PillPal was born from the need to help both carers and patients keep track of their medication, especially for elderly or dement people. The main goal it to improve adherence and reduce the risk of medicine errors.
